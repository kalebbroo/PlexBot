## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Plex Server

**Check server URL and port:**
- Ensure the server address in your `.env` file is correct
- Verify the server is accessible from the machine running PlexBot

**Test connection:**
```bash
curl -H "X-Plex-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" http://your-plex-server:32400
```

### Authentication Issues

If you see "Unauthorized" or "Invalid token" errors:
- Verify your Plex token is correct
- Ensure your Plex account has access to the server
- Try generating a new token

### Track Not Found

If PlexBot cannot find requested tracks:
- Check if the track exists in your Plex library
- Verify the library section name in your configuration
- Try using more specific search terms

### Playback Issues

If tracks are found but won't play:
- Check if your Plex server is configured for remote access
- Ensure the network allows connections between PlexBot and your Plex server
- Verify that direct play is enabled for your music files

## Best Practices

1. **Local Network:** For best performance, run PlexBot on the same network as your Plex server

2. **Library Organization:** Keep your Plex music library well-organized with proper metadata

3. **Remote Access:** If accessing Plex remotely, ensure your server has adequate upload bandwidth

4. **Regular Updates:** Keep both Plex and PlexBot updated to ensure compatibility
