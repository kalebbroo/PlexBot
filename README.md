## üé® Visual Player Styles

PlexBot offers two distinct player UIs:

### 1. Modern Visual Player
- **Sleek, image-based**: Uses album art as a background, overlaying track info and controls for a rich, modern look.
- **Best for dedicated channels**: Looks stunning as a persistent player in a static channel.

### 2. Classic Player Embed
- **Traditional Discord embed**: Familiar, compact, and works anywhere.
- **Great for multi-purpose channels**: Shows album art as a thumbnail.

#### Player Style Configuration
- Set the player style in your `.env` file:
  - `PLAYER_STYLE_VISUAL=true` (Modern Visual)
  - `PLAYER_STYLE_VISUAL=false` (Classic Embed)
- To use a static player channel, set:
  - `USE_STATIC_PLAYER_CHANNEL=true`
  - `STATIC_PLAYER_CHANNEL_ID=<channel_id>`
