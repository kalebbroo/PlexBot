## Static Player Channel

### Features:

- **Persistent Presence**: The player remains in a dedicated channel

- **Server Focal Point**: Provides a central location for music control

### Example:

```
#music-player channel:

[Visual Player Display]
[Interactive Buttons]

Use /play in any channel to add songs to the queue!
```

## Slash Commands Interface

PlexBot uses Discord's slash command system for intuitive interaction:

1. **Command Autocomplete**: Type `/` to see all available commands
2. **Parameter Helpers**: Discord shows required and optional parameters
3. **Inline Documentation**: Brief descriptions appear while typing

### Example Slash Command Flow:

```
/play query:_
```

As you type, Discord shows autocomplete suggestions based on your input.

## Direct Message Interface

PlexBot can also respond to direct messages for private interaction:

- **Help Information**: Get command help without channel clutter
- **Private Feedback**: Receive notifications about server-based actions
- **User Settings**: Configure personal preferences

## Search Results Interface

When searching for music, PlexBot presents results in a clean, interactive format:

```
Search Results for "rock classics":

1. We Will Rock You - Queen (2:02)
2. Sweet Child O' Mine - Guns N' Roses (5:56)
3. Smoke on the Water - Deep Purple (5:40)
4. Back in Black - AC/DC (4:15)
5. Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen (5:55)

Select a track by clicking the corresponding button or typing its number.
```

## UI Customization

### Permissions Setup

Proper permissions ensure the bot functions correctly in your server:

1. **Required Permissions**:
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links
   - Attach Files
   - Use External Emojis
   - Add Reactions
   - Use Application Commands
   - Connect to Voice Channels
   - Speak in Voice Channels

2. **Recommended Permissions**:
   - Manage Messages (for clearing outdated player messages)
   - Create Public Threads (for track discussions)

### Channel Configuration

For optimal use, consider these channel configurations:

1. **Dedicated Bot Channels**:
   - Create a `#music-commands` channel for bot interaction
   - Set up a `#now-playing` channel as your static player channel

2. **Permission Overwrites**:
   - Allow bot to post in channels where others cannot
   - Restrict music commands to specific channels

## Troubleshooting Interface Issues

### Buttons Not Responding

If interactive buttons stop working:

1. Check bot permissions (especially "Use External Emojis")
2. Verify the bot is online and responsive
3. Try using the equivalent slash command
4. Restart the interaction with a new command

### Missing Player Elements

If player displays incorrectly:

1. Ensure bot has "Embed Links" and "Attach Files" permissions
2. Check if visual player is enabled (`PLAYER_STYLE_VISUAL=true`)
3. Verify the bot can access album artwork URLs
4. Confirm font packages are installed in Docker

## Mobile Interface

PlexBot is fully compatible with Discord mobile:

- All buttons and commands work on mobile devices
- Visual player scales to mobile screen size
- Touch interface works with all interactive elements

## Best Practices

1. **Dedicated Channels**: Create specific channels for bot commands and player display
2. **Clear Instructions**: Pin a message with basic commands in your music channel
3. **Proper Permissions**: Ensure the bot has all necessary permissions
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep both Discord and PlexBot updated

## Community Features

Create a more engaging music experience:

1. **Listening Parties**: Schedule events for group listening
2. **Music Discussions**: Create threads from the player message to discuss tracks
3. **Song Requests**: Designate channels for members to request songs
4. **DJ Role**: Create a special role for members who can control music
